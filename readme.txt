EF_Linq_CodeFirst, by Dale Gambill, 9/19/2019

This is a Windows 10 desktop program written in C# using Visual Studio Community 2019. It does the following:

- Demonstrates how to use Entity Framework to create a simple relational database in MS SQL Server v2017.
  This is done by writing C# code to establish a relational data model using C# classes. This means you code first and Entity Framework will create the database in SQL Server for you. The other choice is 
  'database first', which this program does not demonstrate.
  
- Demonstrates using LINQ to query the database.
